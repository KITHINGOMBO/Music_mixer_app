# Music_mixer_app
This application provides a user-friendly interface for recording audio tracks, playing them back, and adjusting their individual volumes. You can also mute tracks and delete them. The AI Mixing Assistant allows you to describe your desired sound or ask for specific mixing advice, and it will provide text-based suggestions using the Gemini API.

Key Features:

Record New Track: Easily capture audio from your microphone.

Track Management: Each recorded track gets its own controls for play/pause, volume adjustment, mute/unmute, and deletion.

AI Mixing Assistant: Input a prompt describing your mixing goals, and the AI will generate suggestions to help you refine your sound.

Persistent Storage: Your recorded tracks are automatically saved to Firestore, so they'll be there even if you close and reopen the app.

Responsive Design: The layout is designed to adapt well to different screen sizes, making it suitable for mobile phones.

After you record a track, it will appear in the "Your Tracks" section. You can then use the sliders and buttons to mix your music. Feel free to experiment with different AI prompts to get creative suggestions!
